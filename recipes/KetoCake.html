        <h2>The Ultimate Flourless Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <p>
            Why should you make this chocolate cake?
            Simply put, because it is quite possibly <strong>the best chocolate cake you will ever make, even if you aren’t on a keto diet.</strong>
            The first time I made the recipe was for a friend’s birthday party, where not a single person in attendance aside from the host was on a low carb diet, and yet people went absolutely crazy for this ultra fudgy chocolate cake. In just a single night, I was already asked by three more friends to make cakes for their birthdays too!

        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8-inch pan, and line with parchment. Stir all ingredients together very well, then spread into the pan. If needed, use a second sheet of parchment to smooth down. Bake 14 minutes on the center rack (some ovens require more baking time, so continue cooking until firm if needed). Let cool completely before frosting. If you try the recipe, please feel free to leave a comment or rate it below!</p></li>
