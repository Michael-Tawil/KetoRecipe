    <h2>ARE CHICKEN NUGGETS KETO?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, none of the store-bought keto nuggets or homemade classic nugget recipes are keto-approved.
        All manufactured nugget recipes include a lot of carbs in the wheat flour and breadcrumb coating.
        Plus, youd be surprised by the other additives that go in the coating, like sugar or vegetable oils, that arenâ€™t keto either.
