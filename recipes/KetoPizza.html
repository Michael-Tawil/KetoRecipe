    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The main complaint over the years has been about the dough sticking. Apart from that cheese queries a plenty. Allow me to address these. It’s best to buy a Silpat for your oven, this is the most efficient of the lot. It’s reusable and it works great. A lot of times the pizza sticks if the parchment paper is of poor quality. Also in India we have things like butter paper which masquerade as parchment paper but aren’t and will 100% stick to your dough.
        Now with the cheese you want shredded mozzarella or the dry kind which you can grate yourself. Fresh mozzarella will not work. I haven’t tried this with cheddar or gruyere or any of these other cheese so I can’t advise you. The cream cheese can be skipped, it will not hamper the recipe much. Hope this clears any doubts.
